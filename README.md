# LDA,QDA and Logistic regression-on-Diabetes-data-set

Produce pairwise scatterplots for all five variables, with different symbols or colors representing the three different classes.
Finding insights of any evidence that the classes may have difference covariance matrices? That they may not be multivariate normal?
Apply linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). 
How does the performance of QDA compare to that of LDA in this case?
